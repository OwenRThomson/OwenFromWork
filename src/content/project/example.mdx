# Introduction

Welcome to the world of **Astro**! If you're looking to build fast, content-focused websites, you've come to the right place. Astro is a revolutionary static site generator that prioritizes performance and developer experience.

## What Makes Astro Special?

Astro stands out from other frameworks in several key ways:

1. **Zero JavaScript by default** - Your site ships with no client-side JavaScript unless you explicitly need it
2. **Island Architecture** - Add interactivity only where needed
3. **Framework Agnostic** - Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework alongside each other
4. **Built for Content** - Perfect for blogs, documentation sites, and marketing pages

### Performance Benefits

> "Astro sites load faster because they ship less JavaScript. It's that simple." - The Astro Team

Here are some impressive performance stats:

- **90%+ reduction** in JavaScript bundle size compared to traditional SPAs
- **Faster Time to Interactive (TTI)** due to minimal hydration
- **Better Core Web Vitals** scores out of the box

## Getting Started

To create a new Astro project, run:

```bash
# Create a new project
npm create astro@latest my-astro-site

# Navigate to your project
cd my-astro-site

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

Your Astro project will have this structure:

```
my-astro-site/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ blog/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

## Building Your First Component

Astro components use a special syntax that combines frontmatter with HTML:

```astro
---
// Component script (runs at build time)
const greeting = "Hello, Astro!";
const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
---

<div class="greeting">
  <h1>{greeting}</h1>
  <p>Welcome to {currentYear}</p>
</div>

<style>
  .greeting {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 2rem;
  }
</style>
```

## Content Collections

One of Astro's most powerful features is **Content Collections**. They provide:

- Type safety for your content
- Automatic slug generation
- Built-in schema validation
- Easy querying and filtering

### Setting Up Collections

Define your collections in `src/content/config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineCollection, z } from "astro:content";

const blogCollection = defineCollection({
  type: "content",
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string().optional(),
    pubDate: z.date(),
    updatedDate: z.date().optional(),
    heroImage: z.string().optional(),
    author: z.string().default("Anonymous"),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
    readingTime: z.string().optional(),
  }),
});

export const collections = {
  blog: blogCollection,
};
```

## Advanced Features

### Island Architecture in Action

You can add interactive components that only hydrate when needed:

```astro
---
import Counter from '../components/Counter.jsx';
import Newsletter from '../components/Newsletter.vue';
---

<div>
  <!-- Static content -->
  <h1>My Blog Post</h1>
  <p>This content is completely static.</p>

  <!-- Interactive islands -->
  <Counter client:visible />
  <Newsletter client:idle />
</div>
```

### Image Optimization

Astro includes built-in image optimization:

```astro
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import heroImage from '../assets/hero.jpg';
---

<Image
  src={heroImage}
  alt="Hero image"
  width={800}
  height={400}
  format="webp"
/>
```

## Best Practices

Here are some tips for getting the most out of Astro:

- **Use static generation** for maximum performance
- **Add interactivity sparingly** - only where truly needed
- **Optimize images** using Astro's built-in tools
- **Leverage Content Collections** for type-safe content management
- **Keep JavaScript minimal** - let Astro handle the heavy lifting

## Conclusion

Astro represents a paradigm shift in web development, prioritizing performance and simplicity without sacrificing developer experience. Whether you're building a personal blog, company website, or documentation site, Astro provides the tools you need to create fast, modern web experiences.

The combination of zero JavaScript by default, flexible architecture, and excellent developer tools makes Astro an excellent choice for content-focused websites. Give it a try for your next project!
