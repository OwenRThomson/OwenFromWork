I always change my mind.

And that's not even mentioning the **framework**.  
I'm learning **React**, but I'm more familiar with **Svelte**. Do I want speed, or do I want to keep learning?

So the idea for this project was simple:  
**Build a site I know I'll want to change later ‚Äî and make sure I have no excuse to start over.**

<RepoCard client:only="react" repoUrl="https://github.com/OwenRThomson/OwenFromWork" />


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) is a static site generator that ships **zero JavaScript by default** ‚Äî so it's blazing fast. The best part? You can use **any frontend framework** you like.

- [**Skeleton UI**](https://www.skeleton.dev/) is a design framework I‚Äôve used before ‚Äî and now it works great with **Svelte**, **React**, and **Astro**.  

Skeleton‚Äôs real superpower? **Themes**.  
You can define a single theme file, and it propagates styling across your entire site. Want to see it in action? Try switching the **theme** or **dark/light mode** from the site menu.

There are a few built-in examples in this blog (see the navbar), but you can design your own theme and drop it right in. üíÖ


## ‚ú® Features

- **Framework Flexibility**  
  Use **React**, **Svelte**, or **both**. You can use anything Astro supports (which is most frameworks).

- **Super Customizable**  
  Quickly apply themes and global styles to make your site truly yours.

- **MDX Support**  
  Write posts in Markdown, sprinkle in React components (like the `RepoCard` above), and mix content and interactivity seamlessly.
